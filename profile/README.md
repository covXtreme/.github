**covXtreme**

covXtreme is statistical software to perform a pragmatic but statistically sound hazard risk analyses that can aid the understanding of extreme events.  

Potential applications include rainfall, temperature and ocean waves, or of man-made systems such as industrial processes and stock-markets.  

covXtreme was primarily developed for oceanographic applications, but it has been used more widely. You will probably find covXtreme interesting, if: 

* You are interested in quantifying extremes using statistical analysis of a data set, and might want to estimate extreme quantiles or “return levels”, 

* The characteristics of your data are not steady; that is, they vary with covariates which you know about, 

* You may be interested in quantifying extremes of multiple variables at the same time, and 

* You want to quantify how confident you can be in your modelling.
